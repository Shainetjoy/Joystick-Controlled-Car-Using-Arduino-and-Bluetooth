# Joystick-Controlled-Car-Using-Arduino-and-Bluetooth
The Joystick Controlled Car project is a wireless robotic vehicle designed to move in all directions based on joystick input. It uses two Arduino boards â€” one acting as a transmitter (controller) and the other as a receiver (car). Communication between them is established using HC-05 Bluetooth modules configured in master and slave modes.
